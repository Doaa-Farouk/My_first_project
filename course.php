        <div class="course"> Previously, "wireless" was synonymous with "Wi-Fi," and many organizations deployed complex security systems to protect these networks. Today, wireless security takes on a much broader meaning â€¦ not only the security of Wi-Fi systems but also
            the security of Bluetooth, ZigBee, RFID, NFC, contactless smart cards, proprietary wireless systems, ..etc </div>
        <div class="course">So it's important for ethical hackers to Understand wireless. And the risks, and vulnerabilities involved with its use. Besides learning to ethically hack they also should learn how to secure networks from hackers. And that is what we will learn
            in this course to protect our personal data, and devices, or organizations.</div>
        <h4>What you'll learn</h4>
        After completing this course you will be able to :
